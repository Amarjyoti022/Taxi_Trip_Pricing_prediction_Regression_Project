# Taxi_Trip_Pricing_prediction_Regression_Project

## Project Overview
### Taxi Trip Pricing Prediction ðŸš–
A machine learning project aimed at accurately predicting taxi fares based on trip details such as distance, time of day, day of week, passenger count, traffic, weather, and fare rate parameters. This project includes end-to-end data handling â€” from cleaning and preprocessing to feature engineering, regression modeling, and business insights.

### Key Highlights

  -> Cleaned and prepared a real-world style dataset with missing values and outliers.

  -> Performed EDA to identify patterns and correlations in taxi pricing.

  -> Engineered new features to improve model accuracy.

  -> Compared multiple regression models including ensemble methods.

  ->Provided actionable insights for taxi fare optimization.
